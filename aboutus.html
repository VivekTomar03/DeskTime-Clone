        <h1>Built first for us, then made available to others</h1>
        <p>DeskTime was born out of the need for the Draugiem Group to manage their many employees. An internal application was developed, <br> and we soon realized that we'd made a tool that could be useful for many other companies. Why not offer it to them?  - we thought. And so, the development began.

           <br >  At DeskTime, we’re committed to accountability, transparency, and fairness. DeskTime is a product designed to increase productivity in an open and empowering environment. <br> The added benefit? Boosting your employees and motivating them to perform at 100% of their potential.</p>
